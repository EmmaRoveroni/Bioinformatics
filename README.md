## Finding structural variations in a genome after comparison with a reference genome 
The genomic reference is a sequence of a bacterium called Lactobacillus casei. The
genome is 3,079,196 bp long. The aim of the project is the "resequencing" of a similar bacterium, called
lact.sp, using mate pairs reads. It is a common practice to call something “sp.” (for species) to indicate that the
species is unknown. In particular, we want to see if lact.sp has genomic structural variations. We suspect that the
lact.sp genome may have small and large deletions, insertions and inversions, and we want to find where they are.
The mate pairs fastq reads are supplied in two files.
